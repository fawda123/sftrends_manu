\section*{Abstract}
\noindent Quantitative descriptions of chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of estuaries are critical for developing an ecological understanding of drivers of change.  Historical trends and relationships between key species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, total) from the Delta region of the \acl{sfe} were modeled with an estuarine adaptation of the \ac{wrtds}. Analysis of flow-normalized data revealed trends that were different from those in the observed time-series. Flow-normalized data exhibited changes in magnitude and even reversal of trends relative to the observed data. Modelled trends demonstrated that nutrient concentrations were on average higher in the last twenty years relative to the earlier periods of observation, although concentrations have been slowly declining since the mid-1990s and early 2000s. We further describe mechanisms of change with two case studies that evaluated 1) downstream changes in nitrogen following upgrades at a wastewater treatment plant, and 2) interactions between biological invaders, chlorophyll, macro-nutrients (nitrogen and silica), and flow in Suisun Bay.  \ac{wrtds} results for ammonium trends showed a distinct signal as a result of upstream \acl{wwtp} upgrades, with specific reductions observed in the winter months during low-flow conditions. Results for Suisun Bay showed that \acl{chla} production in early years was directly stimulated by flow, whereas the relationship with flow in later years was indirect and influenced by grazing pressure. Although these trends and potential causes of change have been described in the literature, results from \ac{wrtds} provided an approach to test alternative hypotheses of spatiotemporal drivers of nutrient dynamics in the Delta.

\section{Introduction}

Understanding drivers of water quality change in estuaries depends on accurate descriptions of source inputs. The Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta (hereafter `Delta') is a mosaic of inflows in the upper \ac{sfe} that receives and processes nutrient inputs from primarily urban sources, in addition to agricultural sources \citep{Jassby00,Jassby02,Jassby08}.  Although water quality conditions in the \ac{sfe} symptomatic of eutrophication have historically been infrequent, recent responses to stressors suggests that ecosystem condition may be changing from past norms. Changes in phytoplankton biomass and composition, water clarity changes from sediment alteration, increases in harmful cyanobacterial blooms (\textit{Microcystis aeruginosa}), increases in non-native macrophytes, and periodic events of low dissolved oxygen have been a recent concern for management of the Delta \citep{Lehman05,Santos09,Hestir13,Lehman15,Dahm16,ASC17}. Although these changes are linked to drivers at different spatial and temporal scales, describing inputs from the Delta is critical to understand downstream effects.

Rates of primary production in coastal habitats are often defined by nutrient concentrations, although a simple relationship between enrichment and water quality changes can be difficult to determine \citep{Cloern01}. Nutrient concentrations are generally non-limiting for phytoplankton growth in the upper \ac{sfe}, whereas light availability is the primary limiting factor preventing accumulation of phytoplankton biomass \citep{Cole84,Alpine88}. Grazing pressure from pelagic fishes and benthic invertebrates can also reduce phytoplankton during periods of growth \citep{Nichols85,Jassby08,Kimmerer14}.  Moreover, changes in flow management practices compounded with climate variation have altered flushing rates and turbidity as key factors that moderate phytoplankton growth in the system \citep{Alpine92,Lehman00,Wright04,Canuel09}.  \citet{Glibert14} attributed recent phytoplankton blooms in Suisun Bay to a drought, during which residence times and nitrification rates increased.  Speciation changes in the dominant forms of nitrogen confound a direct interpretation of links with phytoplankton blooms and the relationships between nutrients and primary production in the upper estuary are not completely understood. Although phytoplankton concentrations have been relatively consistent in recent years in Suisun Bay, biomass trends in the Delta are mixed \citep{Jassby08,ASC17}. Descriptions of nitrogen trends over several decades could be used to better understand long-term and more recent changes, particularly in the context of primary production and physical drivers of change \citep{Dahm16}.

Long-term monitoring data are powerful sources of information that can facilitate descriptions of water quality change. A comprehensive water quality monitoring program has been in place in the upper \ac{sfe} for several decades \citep[\cref{fig:delt_map},][]{IEP13}.  Although these data have been used extensively \citep[e.g.,][]{Lehman92,Jassby08,Glibert10}, water quality trends covering the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Delta have not been systematically evaluated. Quantitative descriptions of nutrient dynamics are challenging given multiple sources and the volume of water that is exchanged with natural and anthropogenic processes.  An evaluation using mass-balance models to describe nutrient dynamics in the Delta demonstrated that the majority of ammonium entering the system during the summer is nitrified or assimilated, whereas a considerable percentage of total nitrogen load to the Delta is exported \citep{Novick15}. Seasonal and annual changes in the delivery of water inflows and water exports directly from the system can also obscure trends \citep{Jassby00,Jassby08}. It is important to consider these variable effects to characterize different trends in nitrogen forms.

Formal methods for trend analysis are required to describe water quality changes that vary by space and time. As a practical approach for water quality evaluation, trend analysis of ecosystem response indicators often focuses on tracking the change in concentrations or loads of nutrients over many years. Response indicators can vary naturally with changing flow conditions and may also reflect long-term effects of management or policy changes. Similarly, nutrient trends that vary with hydrologic loading can vary as a function of utilization rates by primary producers or decomposition processes \citep{Sakamoto89,Schultz08,Harding16}.  Concentration of \ac{chla} as a measure of phytoplankton response to nutrient inputs can follow seasonal patterns with cyclical variation in temperature and light changes throughout each year, whereas annual trends can follow long-term variation in nutrient inputs to the system \citep{Cloern96,Cloern10}.  Describing the relationship of a water quality variable as changing (chemodynamic) or invariant (chemostatic) with flow can isolate components, such as nutrient inputs, for a more direct assessment of causal factors \citep{Wan17}.  

The \ac{wrtds} approach was developed in this context and has been used to characterize decadal trends in river systems \citep{Hirsch10,Sprague11,Medalie12,Hirsch14,Pellerin14,Zhang16}.  The \ac{wrtds} method has been adapted for trend analysis in tidal waters, with a focus on \ac{chla} trends in Tampa Bay \citep{Beck15} and the Patuxent River Estuary \citep{Beck17}. Although the \ac{wrtds} method has been effectively applied to describe changes in freshwater systems, use in tidally influenced systems has not been as extensive.  Application of \ac{wrtds} to describe trends in estuaries could reveal new insights given the disproportionate effects of physical drivers, such as flow inputs and tidal exchange, on water quality. The effects of biological drivers may also be more apparent because hydrological effects can be removed by \ac{wrtds}.  As such, application of \ac{wrtds} models for trend analysis could facilitate a broader discusion on the need to focus beyond nutrients to develop integrated plans for water quality management. 

The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive description of nutrient trends in the Delta and Suisun Bay over the last forty years.  This information can inform the  understanding of ecosystem response dynamics and potential causes of water quality change. The specific objectives were to \begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]  
\item quantify and interpret trends over four decades at ten stations in the Delta and Suisun Bay, including annual, seasonal, and spatial changes in nitrogen forms and response to flow variation, and
\item provide detailed descriptions of two case studies in the context of conceptual relationships modeled with \ac{wrtds}.
\end{inparaenum}
The second objective evaluated two specific water quality stations to demonstrate complexities with nutrient response to flow, effects of nutrient-related source controls on ambient conditions, and effects of biological invasion by benthic filter feeders on nutrient cycling and primary production.  Our general hypothesis was that the results were expected to support previous descriptions of trends in this well-studied system, but that new insight into spatial and temporal variation in response endpoints was expected, particuarly in flow-normalized model predictions.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Study system}

The Delta region drains a 200 thousand km$^2$ watershed into the \ac{sfe}, which is the largest estuary on the Pacific coast of North America.  The watershed provides water to over 25 million people and irrigation for 18 thousand km$^2$ of agricultural land.  Water enters the \ac{sfe} through the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers that have a combined inflow of approximately 28 km$^3$ per year, with the Sacramento accounting for 84\% of inflow to the Delta.  The \ac{sfe} system includes the Delta and subembayments of San Francisco Bay (\cref{fig:delt_map}).  Water dynamics in the \ac{sfe} and Delta are governed by inflows from the watershed, tidal exchange with the Pacific Ocean, and water withdrawals for municipal and agricultural use \citep{Jassby00}.  Seasonally, inflows from the watershed peak in the spring and early summer from snowmelt, whereas consumption, withdrawals, and export have steadily increased from 1960 to present, but vary depending on inter-annual climate effects \citep{Cloern12b}. Notable drought periods have occurred from 1976-1977, 1987-1992, and recently from 2013-2015 \citep{Cloern15}.

Orthophosphate (PO$_4^{3-}$) and \ac{din} enter the Delta primarily through the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and from municipal \ac{wwtp} inputs.  Annual nutrient export from the Delta region has been estimated as approximately 30 thousand kg d$^{-1}$ of total nitrogen \citep[varying with flow,][]{Novick15}, with 90\% of ammonium (NH$_4^{+}$) originating solely from the Sacramento Regional \ac{wwtp} \citep{Jassby08}.  Although nitrogen and phosphorus inputs are considerable, primary production is relatively low and not nutrient-limited \citep{Jassby02,Kimmerer12}.

\subsection{Data sources}

% censored percentages


Nutrient time series of monthly observations from 1976 to 2013 were obtained for ten active sampling stations in the Delta \citep[\cref{fig:delt_map,tab:stdescrp},][]{IEP13}.  Stations were grouped by location in the study area for comparison: \textit{peripheral} Delta stations C3 (Sacramento inflow), C10 (San Joaquin inflow), MD10, and P8; \textit{interior} Delta stations D19, D26, and D28; and \textit{Suisun} stations D4, D6, and D7.  These stations cover all of the major inflows and outflows to the Delta and were selected for analysis based on the continuity of the period of observation \citep{Jabusch09}. Although many other stations are available for the region, the stations were chosen because they represent a consistent long-term dataset generated by a single program and they capture dominant seasonal and annual modes of nitrogen variability characteristic of the region \citep{Jabusch16}. Time series were complete for all stations except for an approximate ten year gap from 1996-2004 for D19.  Data were minimally processed, with the exception of averaging replicates that occurred on the same day.  The three nitrogen forms that were evaluated were ammonium, nitrite/nitrate, and \ac{din} (as the sum of the former two). Less than 3\% of all observations were below the detection limit (left-censored), although variation was observed between analytes and location.  The ammonium time series had the most censored observations at sites C10 (25.4\% of all observations), MD10 (18.1\%), D28 (17.8\%), D19 (12\%), and D7 (7.9\%).

\ac{wrtds} models require flow data paired with nutrient data. At the Delta stations, daily flow estimates were matched with the corresponding sample dates for the nutrient data. Daily flow estimates were obtained from the Dayflow software program \citep{IEP16}.  The Sacramento daily flow time series was used to account for flow effects at C3, D19, D26, D28, and MD10, and the San Joaquin time series was used for C10 and P8 based on station proximity to each inflow. Given the complexity of inflows and connectivity of the system, only the inflow estimates from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers were used as measures of freshwater influence at each station.  Initial analyses indicated that model fit was not significantly improved with flow estimates from locations closer to each station, nor was model fit improved using lagged times series. Salinity was used as a proxy for flow at the Suisun Bay sites D4, D6, and D7 where tidal influences were much stronger. Salinity has been used as a tracer of freshwater influence for the application of \ac{wrtds} models in tidal waters \citep{Beck15}.  Models were evaluated using salinity at the Delta stations, but performance was reduced relative to models that used daily flow estimates. 

\subsection{Analysis method and application}

A total of thirty \ac{wrtds} models were created, one for each nitrogen form at each station.  The functional form of \ac{wrtds} is a simple regression \citep{Hirsch10} that models the log-transformed response variable as a function of time, flow, and season:

\begin{equation}
\ln\left(N\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 \ln\left(Q\right) + \beta_3 \sin\left(2\pi t\right) + \beta_4 \cos\left(2\pi t\right)
\end{equation}  

% n min/max


\noindent where $N$ is one of three nitrogen analytes, time $t$ is a continuous variable as decimal time to capture the annual ($\beta_1$) or seasonal ($\beta_3$, $\beta_4$) trend, and $Q$ is the flow variable (either flow or salinity depending on station).  

The \ac{wrtds} model is a moving window regression that fits unique parameters (i.e., $\beta_0$, \ldots, $\beta_4$) at each observation point in the time series ($n$ ranging from 433 at D19 to 571 at C3).  Rather than fitting a global model to the entire time series, one regression is fit to every observation.  Observations within a window for each regression are weighted relative to annual, seasonal, and flow distances from the observation at the center of the window.  Observations with distances farther from the center (i.e., greater time and different flow values from the center) have less weight during parameter estimation for each regression.  This approach allows for a type of smoothing where the observed fit is specific to the data characteristics within windows. Models applied herein were based on a tidal adaptation of the original method that can use either flow or salinity estimates as nutrient predictors \citep{Beck15}.  All models were fit to describe the conditional mean response using a weighted Tobit model for left-censored data below the detection limit \citep{Tobin58}.  Model predictions were evaluated as monthly values or as annual values that averaged monthly results within each water year (October to September). All analyses used the WRTDStidal package for the R statistical programming language \citep{Beck17b,RDCT17}.  The default model fitting procedures were used that set half-window widths as six months for seasonal weights, ten years for annual weights, and half the range of salinity or flow in the input data for $Q$ weights.

A hallmark of the \ac{wrtds} approach is the description of flow-normalized trends that are independent of variation from freshwater inflows \citep{Hirsch10} or tidal variation \citep{Beck15}. Flow-normalized trends for each analyte at each station were used to describe long-term changes in different annual and seasonal periods. Flow-normalization predictions for each month of each year were based on the average of predictions for flow values that occur in the same month across all years, weighted within each specific month and year for every observation. Flow-normalized trends in each analyte were summarized as both medians and percent changes from the beginning to end of annual groupings from 1976-1995 and 1996-2013, and seasonal groupings of March-April-May (spring), June-July-August (summer), September-October-November (fall), and December-January-February (winter) within each annual grouping. Annual groupings were chosen as approximate twenty year midpoints in the time series and seasonal groupings were chosen to evaluate inter-annual changes while keeping season constant. 

Trends in each annual and seasonal grouping were based on seasonal Kendall tests of the flow-normalized predictions. This test is a modification of the non-parametric Kendall test that accounts for variation across seasons in the response variable \citep{Hirsch82,Millard13}.  Results from the test can be used to evaluate the direction, magnitude, and significance of a monotonic change within the period of observation.  The estimated rate of change per year is also returned as the Theil-Sen slope and was interpreted as the percent change per year when divided by the median value of the response variable in the period of observation \citep{Jassby08}.  Trends in annual groupings were based on all monthly observations within relevant years, whereas seasonal groupings were based only on the relevant months across years.  Seasonal Kendall tests were also used to describe trends in the observed data.  These trends were compared with those based on the flow-normalized trends to evaluate potential differences in conclusions caused by flow effects.

\subsection{Selected examples}

Two stations were chosen to demonstrate use of \ac{wrtds} to develop a more comprehensive description of decadal trends in the Delta.  The selected case studies focused on \begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]		
\item effects of wastewater treatment upgrades upstream of P8, and		
\item effects of biological invasion on nutrient dynamics in Suisun Bay using observations from D7.		
\end{inparaenum}		
Each case study is built around hypotheses that results from \ac{wrtds} models were expected to support, both as a general description and for additional testing with alternative methods. 

\subsubsection{Effects of wastewater treatment}

Significant efforts have been made in recent years to reduce nitrogen loading from regional \acp{wwtp} given the disproportionate contribution of nutrients relative to other sources  \citep{Cornwell14,Novick15}.  Several \acp{wwtp} in the Delta have recently been or are planned to be upgraded to include tertiary filtration and nitrification to convert biologically available ammonium to nitrate. The City of Stockton \ac{wwtp} was upgraded in 2006 and is immediately upstream of station P8 \citep{Jabusch16}, which provides a valuable opportunity to assess how nutrient or nutrient-related source controls and water management actions have changed ambient concentrations downstream. A decrease of ammonium concentrations at P8 after 2006 is expected as a result of upstream \ac{wwtp} upgrades, and water quality should exhibit \begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]
\item a shift in the ratio of the components of \ac{din} from the \ac{wwtp} before/after upgrade, and
\item a flow-normalized annual trend at P8 to show a change concurrent with \ac{wwtp} upgrades.
\end{inparaenum}

\subsubsection{Effects of biological invasions}

Invasion of the upper \ac{sfe} by the Asian clam \textit{Potamocorbula amurensis} in 1986 caused severe changes in phytoplankton abundance and species composition.  Reduction in phytoplankton biomass has altered trophic networks in the upper \ac{sfe} and is considered an important mechanism in the decline of the protected delta smelt (\textit{Hypomesus transpacificus}) and other important fisheries \citep{Feyrer03,MacNally10}.  Changes in the physical environment have also occurred, particularly increased water clarity from a reduction of particle transport and erodible sediment supply \citep{Jassby08,Schoellhamer11,Cloern12b}, although decreases in phytoplankton by clam biofiltration may have also increased clarity \citep{MacNally10}. The clams are halophilic such that drought years are correlated with an increase in biomass and further upstream invasion of the species \citep{Parchaso02,Cloern12b}. We hypothesized that results from \ac{wrtds} models would show \begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]
\item a decline in annual, flow-normalized chlorophyll concentrations over time coincident with an increase in abundance of invaders, and
\item variation in the chlorophyll/clam relationship through indirect or direct controls of flow.
\end{inparaenum}
Although the relationship between phytoplankton and clams in the upper \ac{sfe} has been well described \citep{Kimmerer14}, we use \ac{wrtds} to develop additional evidence that an increase in \ac{din} was facilitated in part by clam invasion and the relationship of phytoplankton with clam abundance was mediated by flow and climatic variation in recent years.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Observed data and modelled trends}

% mle summaries of obs data


The observed time series for the ten Delta - Suisun Bay stations had substantial variation in scale among the nitrogen analytes and differences in apparent seasonal trends (\cref{fig:obsdat}).  \ac{din} for most stations was dominated by nitrite/nitrate, whereas ammonium was a smaller percentage of the total.  However, C3 had a majority of \ac{din} composed of ammonium and other stations (e.g., P8, D26) had higher concentrations of ammonium during winter months when assimilation rates are lower \citep{Novick15}.  By location, observed concentrations of \ac{din} for the entire time series were higher on average for the peripheral Delta stations (C3, C10, MD10, P8; mean $\pm$ s.e.: $1.04$$\pm$$0.03$ \mgl) and similar for the interior Delta (D19, D26, D28, $0.43$$\pm$$0.01$) and Suisun Bay stations (D4, D6, D7, $0.44$$\pm$$0.01$).  Average concentrations were highest at P8 ($1.63$$\pm$$0.05$ \mgl) and lowest at C3 ($0.4$$\pm$$0.01$) for \ac{din}, highest at P8 ($0.28$$\pm$$0.02$) and lowest at D28 ($0.05$$\pm$$0.003$) for ammonium, and highest at C10 ($1.4$$\pm$$0.04$) and lowest at C3 ($0.15$$\pm$$0.004$) for nitrite/nitrate. Mean observed concentrations were also higher later in the time series for all analytes.  For example, average \ac{din} across all stations was $0.61$$\pm$$0.01$ \mgl for 1976-1995, compared to $0.7$$\pm$$0.01$ for 1996-2013. Seasonal changes across all years showed that nitrogen concentrations were generally lower in the summer and higher in the winter, although observed patterns were inconsistent between sites.  For example, site MD10 had distinct seasonal spikes for elevated \ac{din} in the winter, whereas other stations had less prominent seasonal maxima (e.g., C3, D7, \cref{fig:obsdat}).  

Relative to the observed data, long-term trends between stations for the different nitrogen analytes were apparent from the modelled results (\cref{fig:prddat}).  Although each station varied in the overall concentrations, patterns within the three regions (peripheral Delta, interior Delta, and Suisun Bay) were observed.  Concentrations for all nitrogen analytes were highest in the peripheral stations.  Ammonium concentrations were highest at P8 and C3 and showed a consistent increase over time, followed by a reduction beginning in the early 2000s, whereas ammonium concentrations at C10 and MD10 were low and gradually decreasing throughout the period of record.  By contrast, \ac{din} and nitrite/nitrate concentrations at the peripheral Delta stations showed increases at  P8 and C10 followed by a decline in the early 2000s, whereas concentrations at C3 and MD10 were lower and did not show any noticeable trends.  Trends at the interior Delta stations showed a gradual increase in ammonium followed by a gradual decrease beginning in the early 1990s, particularly for D26.  Trends in \ac{din} and nitrite/nitrate for the interior Delta stations showed a reduction early in the time series, followed by a slight increase beginning in the mid-1980s, and finally a reduction beginning in the late 1990s.  These trends were similar for the Suisun Bay stations, although the reduction in the late 1990s did not occur.  By contrast, ammonium concentrations were low in Suisun Bay but a gradual increase over the period of record was observed.  

\subsection{Trend tests}



Estimated trends from Seasonal Kendall tests on the raw time series varied considerably between sites and analytes (\cref{fig:trndcomp1}). Significant trends were observed from 1976-1995 for eight of ten sites for \ac{din} (seven increasing, one decreasing), eight sites for ammonium (six increasing, two decreasing), and six sites for nitrite/nitrate (five increasing, one decreasing).  Decreasing trends were more common for the observed data from 1996-2013.  Eight sites had significant trends for \ac{din} (four increasing, four decreasing), seven sites for ammonium (five increasing, two decreasing), and eight sites for nitrite/nitrate (four increasing, four decreasing). P8 had a relatively large decrease in ammonium ($-8.3$\% change per year) for the second annual period compared to all other sites. Trends by season were similar such that increases were generally observed in all seasons from 1976-1995 (\cref{fig:trndcomp2}) and decreases were observed for 1996-2013 (\cref{fig:trndcomp3}).  Trends for the seasonal comparisons were noisier and significant changes were less common compared to the annual comparisons.


A comparison of flow-normalized results from \ac{wrtds} relative to observed data identified changes in the magnitude, significance, and direction of trends. For all sixty trend comparisons in \cref{fig:trndcomp1} (flow-normalized values in \cref{tab:trndsann}) regardless of site, nitrogen analyte, and time period (annual or seasonal aggregations), thirteen comparisons had trends that were insignificant ($p > 0.05$) with the observed data but significant with flow-normalized results, whereas only one trend changed to insignificant. This suggests that time series that include flow effects had sufficient noise to obscure or prevent identification of an actual trend of a water quality parameter. Further, changes in the magnitude of the estimated percent change per year were also apparent for the flow-normalized trends, such that fourteen comparisons showed an increase in magnitude (more negative or more positive) and twenty five had a decrease (less positive or less negative) compared to observed trends.  Eleven comparisons showed a trend reversal from positive to negative estimated change, nine sites went from no change to negative estimated change, and one site went from no change to a positive trend for the flow-normalized results. Differences by season in the observed relative to flow-normalized trends from \ac{wrtds} were also apparent (\cref{fig:trndcomp2,fig:trndcomp3,tab:trndsbef,tab:trndsaft}). The most notable change in the flow-normalized results was an overall decrease (less positive trend or greater negative trend) in concentrations for most sites in the summer and fall seasons for 1996-2013.  More statistically significant trends were also observed with the flow-normalized results.

\subsection{Selected examples}

\subsubsection{Effects of wastewater treatment}



Effluent measured from 2003 to 2009 from the Stockton \ac{wwtp} had similar \ac{din} concentrations before and after upgrades, whereas ammonium concentrations were greatly reduced (\cref{fig:stock}).  Ammonium and nitrate concentrations were comparable prior to 2006, whereas nitrate was a majority of total nitrogen after the upgrade, with much smaller percentages from ammonium and nitrite. As expected, flow-normalized nitrogen trends at P8 shifted in response to upstream \ac{wwtp} upgrades (\cref{fig:p8trnds}a), with ammonium showing an increase from 1976 followed by a large reduction in the 2000s.  Nitrite/nitrate concentrations at P8 also showed a similar but less dramatic decrease despite an increase in the \ac{wwtp} effluent concentrations following the upgrade (\cref{fig:stock}).  Percent changes from seasonal Kendall tests on flow-normalized results (\cref{tab:p8chg}) showed that both nitrogen species increased prior to \ac{wwtp} upgrades ($2$\% per year for nitrite/nitrate, $2.8$\% for ammonium), followed by decreases after upgrades ($-1.9$\% for nitrite/nitrate, $-16.6$\% for ammonium).  Seasonally, increases prior to upgrades were highest in the summer for nitrite/nitrate ($2.4$\%) and in the fall for ammonium ($4.9$\%). Similarly, seasonal reductions post-upgrade were largest in the summer for nitrite/nitrate ($-4.3$\%) and largest for ammonium in the winter ($-26.7$\%).

Nitrogen concentrations varied with flow, although relationships depended on season and year. Relationships of nitrite/nitrate with flow described by \ac{wrtds} showed flushing or dilution at higher flow (\cref{fig:p8trnds}b).  Seasonal variation was even more apparent for ammonium, although both nitrite/nitrate and ammonium typically had the highest concentrations at low flow in the winter (January).  Additionally, strength of the flow/nutrient relationship changed between years. Nitrite/nitrate typically had the strongest relationship with flow later in the time series (i.e., larger negative slope), whereas ammonium had the strongest relationship with flow around 2000 in January. 

\subsubsection{Effects of biological invasions}

Invasion in the 1980s showed a clear reduction of \textit{Corbicula fluminea} and increase of \textit{P. amurensis} (\cref{fig:clmchl}a), where biomass of the latter was negatively associated with flow from the Sacramento river (\Cref{fig:clmchl}b).  The increase in clam abundance was associated with a notable decrease in annually-averaged \ac{chla} from \ac{wrtds} results (\cref{fig:clmchl}c), as expected if \ac{wrtds} is adequately capturing flow variation and identifying the well-established phytoplankton decrease beginning in the 1980s.  A seasonal shift in the flow-normalized results was also observed such that \ac{chla} concentrations were generally highest in July/August prior to invasion, whereas a spring maximum in April was more common in recent years (\cref{fig:clmchl}f).  An increase in annually-averaged silicon dioxide (\cref{fig:clmchl}d) was coincident with the \ac{chla} decrease, with the largest increases occuring in August (\cref{fig:clmchl}g).   Further, \ac{din} trends were similar to silicon-dioxide in both annual and seasonal changes (i.e., Figures \ref{fig:clmchl}e and \ref{fig:clmchl}h compared to \ref{fig:clmchl}d and \ref{fig:clmchl}g), such that an increase in both nutrients earlier in the time series corresponded with the decrease in \ac{chla}.

The relationship of \ac{chla} with clam biomass was significant (\cref{fig:clmchl}i), with lower \ac{chla} associated with higher biomass. However, the effect of flow on both clams and phytoplankton as a top-down or bottom-up control changed throughout the time series.  The \ac{chla}/flow relationship showed that increasing flow (decreasing salinity) was associated with a slight increase in \ac{chla} followed by a decrease early in the time series (\cref{fig:clmchl}j), whereas overall \ac{chla} was lower but a positive association with flow (negative with salinity) was observed later in the time series. Following clam invasion, \ac{chla} concentrations were reduced by grazing but showed a positive and monotonic relationship with increasing flow. The increase in clam abundance was concurrent with decline in \ac{chla} concentration, although variation in abundance between years was also observed.  Clam abundance was reduced during high flow years in the late 1990s, 2006, and 2011 (\ref{fig:clmchl}a). In the same years, \ac{wrtds} predictions for \ac{chla} were higher than the flow-normalized component (\cref{fig:clmchl}c), which further suggests a link between increased flow and phytoplankton production.

\section{Discussion}

Water quality conditions in the Delta-Suisun Bay region are dynamic and not easily characterized from observed time series.  Annual aggregations of \ac{wrtds} modelled results and application of formal trend analyses provided insight into the spatial and temporal variation of nitrogen analytes in three distinct regions that is not possible with raw observations.  A general conclusion is that nitrogen concentrations have showed a consistent decrease beginning in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, although average concentrations remain above those observed earlier in the period of record.  These results are confirmed visually from \ac{wrtds} (\cref{fig:prddat}) and through significant results from trend tests (\cref{fig:trndcomp1}, \cref{tab:trndsann}).  Although the overall trends suggest a system-wide reduction, considerable differences by location and analyte were characterized by the analysis and are important independent of overall trends.  Nutrient concentrations were highest at peripheral Delta stations (C3, MD10, P8, and C10) that monitor inflows from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.  The highest concentrations among all nitrogen analytes, ammonium in particular, were observed at P8 in the early 2000s as a direct consequence of \ac{wwtp} inputs upstream prior to infrastructure upgrades.  Elevated ammonium concentrations were also observed at C3 as a measure of upstream contributions from the Sacramento \ac{wwtp}.  By contrast, nitrite/nitrate concentrations were highest at C10 as a measure of contributions from the San Joaquin River to the south that drains a predominantly agricultural watershed.

Differing magnitudes of nitrogen analytes between stations as a function of source type can have an effect on the relationship between flow and nutrients.  Both \citet{Hirsch10} and \citet{Beck15} used \ac{wrtds} results to demonstrate variation between flow and nutrient dynamics depending on pollutant sources.  In particular, a chemodynamic (i.e., changing) response of nutrients with flow variation is common if nutrients originate primarily from the watershed through diffuse sources \citep{Thompson11,Wan17}.  Increased flow may induce a change in nutrient concentrations, such that reduction may occur with flushing or an increase may occur through mobilization.  By contrast, nutrient loads are relatively chemostatic or invariant with changes in flow if point-sources are the dominant contributor.  These relationships are modelled particularly well with \ac{wrtds}, which can provide a means of hypothesizing unknown sources or verifying trends in response to management actions.  As noted above, C10 at the inflow of the San Joaquin River is dominated by nitrite/nitrate consistent with diffuse, agricultural inputs from the watershed.  A logical expectation is that trends from observed data may vary considerably from trends with modelled results that are flow-normalized.  Accordingly, trend analysis of nitrate/nitrate by year and season showed that percent changes at C10 were typically underestimated with the observed data during the recent period from 1996-2013 (\cref{tab:trndsann,tab:trndsaft}).  This is consistent with an expected effect of flow on raw time series, particularly for chemodynamic behavior at locations that drain highly altered watersheds \citep{Wan17}.

% obs v flow norm trends
Our results underscore the importance of considering flow effects in the evaluation of water quality trends. There were important differences in trends between observed and flow-normalized data. These differences ranged from a simple change in the magnitude and significance of a trend, to more problematic changes where the flow-normalized trend could demonstrate a complete reversal relative to the observed (e.g., \ac{din} trends for all Suisun stations from 1996-2013, \cref{fig:trndcomp1}). Differences in apparent trends underscore the importance of considering flow effects in the interpretation of environmental changes, particularly if trend evaluation is used to assess the effects of nutrients on ecosystem health or the effectiveness of past nutrient management actions. An alternative evaluation of flow in the Delta demonstrated that flow contributions from different sources vary considerably over time at each station \citep{Novick15}.  For example, flow at MD10 represents seasonally changing inputs from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and other sources. For simplicity, our analysis considered only the dominant water source and used the total daily inflow estimates from either the Sacramento River or the San Joaquin River at any of the Delta sites. Given that substantial differences with flow-normalized results were apparent from relatively coarse estimates of flow contributions, more precise differences could be obtained by considering the influence of multiple flow components at each location. Output from the Dayflow software program \citep{IEP16} provides a complete mass balance of flow in the Delta that could be used to develop a more comprehensive description.  Our analysis is the first attempt to model nutrient dynamics related to flow in the entire Delta, such that additional work should focus on improving the characterization of flow signals at each station.

Long-term trends in nutrient and phytoplankton concentations in Suisun Bay have also been the focus of intense study for many years \citep{Cloern83,Lehman92,Dugdale07,Jassby08,Glibert14}. Our results demonstrated an overall increase in ammonium from the late 1970s to 2000, with initial flow-normalized values of annual averages estimated as approximately 0.05 mg L$^-1$ for the Suisun stations in 1976 to a maximum ranging from 0.08 mg L$^{-1}$ (station D4) to above 0.1 mg L$^{-1}$ (D6) in 2000 (\cref{fig:prddat}).  Trends from 1996-2005 evaluated in \citep{Jassby08} showed a similar increase in ammonium.  However, a reversal of trends in recent years may also be occuring in Suisun Bay, as model estimates suggest either relatively constant concentrations or even a decrease at some stations beginning around 2000 (e.g., D6, D7, \cref{fig:trndcomp1}).  Combined with the shift towards a dominant spring peak in chloropyll growth (\cref{fig:clmchl}f), changing nitrogen ratios continue to be a concern for the management of production in the upper \ac{sfe}. 

\subsection{Interpretation of case studies}

Seasonal timings of water quality improvements and the link to flow changes are difficult to characterize from the observed time series. \ac{wrtds} models were used to characterize these changes at P8 and to develop additional hypotheses of factors that influence nutrient concentrations. A general conclusion is that ammonium reductions were concurrent with \ac{wwtp} upgrades, but the reduction was most apparent at low-flow in January. Estimated ammonium concentrations in July were low for all flow levels, which suggests either nitrogen inputs were low in the summer or nitrogen was available but uptake by primary consumers and bacterial processing were high. Seasonal patterns in the relationship between flow and nitrite/nitrate were not as dramatic as compared to ammonium, and in particular, low-flow events in July were associated with higher concentrations.  This could suggest that ammonium concentrations at P8 are driving phytoplankton production at low flow during warmer months, and not nitrite/nitrate given the higher estimated concentrations in July at low flow. As such, these simple observations provide quantitative support of cause and effect mechanisms of nutrient impacts on potentially adverse environmental conditions as they relate to nutrient-related source controls upstream.  Additional research could investigate these hypotheses to better describe mechanisms of change as a basis for more informed management.

The results for Suisun Bay provide additional descriptions of change in production as it relates to flow, grazing, and nitrogen ratios.  In general, clam biomass was associated with a decrease in \ac{chla} concentration, as shown by others \citep{Alpine92,Thompson08}. Our results also suggested that diatoms were the dominant genera early in the time series, particularly in late summer, whereas the spring peak observed in later years represents a shift to an earlier seasonal maxima. This supports past research that showed a decrease in silica uptake by diatoms following invasion \citep{Cloern96,Kimmerer05}. A nontrivial portion of the \ac{din} increase could be related to the decrease in a major `sink', i.e., decreased \ac{din} uptake by phytoplankton due to top down grazing pressure from \textit{P. amurensis}.  Flow effects on phytoplankton production have also changed over time. In the absence of benthic grazing prior to invasion, \ac{chla} production was limited at low flow as less nutrients were exported from the Delta, stimulated as flow increases, and reduced at high flow as either nutrients or phytoplankton biomass are exported to the estuary (\cref{fig:clmchl}j). Recent years have shown a decrease in overall chlorophyll, with particularly low concentrations at low flow (high salinity).  As such, \ac{chla} production in early years is directly related to flow, whereas the relationship with flow in later years is indirect as increased flow reduces clam abundance and releases phytoplankton from benthic grazing pressure. These relationships have been suggested by others \citep{Cloern83,Alpine92,Parchaso02,Jassby08}, although the precise mechanisms demonstrated by \ac{wrtds} provide additonal quantitative evidence of factors that drive water quality in the Delta.
 
\subsection{Conclusions}

As demonstrated by both case studies and the overall trends across all stations, water quality dynamics in the Delta are complex and driven by multiple factors that change through space and time. \ac{wrtds} models can facilitate descriptions of change by focusing on high-level forcing factors that explicitly account for annual, seasonal, and flow effects on trend interpretations.  We have demonstrated the potential for imprecise or inaccurate conclusions of trend tests that focus solely on observed data and emphasize that flow-normalized trends have more power to quantify change.  The results from \ac{wrtds} are also consistent with described trends of nutrient loads from point sources \citep[e.g., Sacramento \ac{wwtp} increases and exports to Suisun Bay,][]{Jassby08,Novick14}, demonstrating that these changes are not unexpected.  Consequently, we are not detracting from the potential implications of such increases. The important conclusion is that the physical/hydrological and biogeochemical factors that influence nutrient cycling and ambient concentrations in the Bay-Delta, and changes to those factors, are substantial enough that they can be comparable in magnitude to anthropogenic load increases or comparable to the effects of management actions to decrease nutrient levels. Therefore, methods that adjust for the effects of these factors are critical when studying long-term records to assess the impacts or effectiveness of load increases or management actions, respectively.

Combined with additional data, our results can support hypotheses that lead to a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Additional factors to consider include the effects of large-scale climatic patterns, more detailed hydrologic descriptions, and additional ecological components that affect trophic interactions.  For example, a more rigorous matching of flow time series with water quality observations at each station that considers varying source contributions over time could provide a more robust description of flow effects.  Alternative methods could also be used to address a wider range of questions, particularly those with more generic structural forms that can explicitly include additional variables \citep[e.g., generalized additive models,][]{Beck17}.  Overall, quantitative interpretations of multiple factors can provide a more comprehensive understanding of relationships between nutrients and primary production, including adverse effects on ecosystem condition.
